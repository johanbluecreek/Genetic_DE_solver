# Genetic DE solver

This is a differential equations solver that finds analytical solutions using genetic programming. This is written in [Julia](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia) and relies on the [Calculus](https://github.com/johnmyleswhite/Calculus.jl) package for symbolic derivatives, and fitness is calculated with the help of [meval-rs](https://github.com/rekka/meval-rs), a [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) library.

## Introduction

The inspiration for this project is taken from

* **[TL]** TSOULOS, Ioannis G. et LAGARIS, Isaac E. "*Solving differential equations with genetic programming*". Genetic Programming and Evolvable Machines, 2006, vol. 7, no 1, p. 33-54.

the following books have been used as a reference

* **[MF]** "*How to Solve It: Modern Heuristics*" by Zbigniew Michalewicz, David
B. Fogel
* **[E]** "*Computational Intelligence: An Introduction*" by Andries P.
Engelbrecht

## Overview

The solutions are found using the following structure

<table>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="13"><b>Individual</b><br/> Represents solution to system of differential equations </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="4"><b>Chromosome</b><br/> Expression for Function <code>1</code> </td>
    <td colspan="4"><b>Chromosome</b><br/> Expression for Function <code>2</code> </td>
    <td ><b>...</b></td>
    <td colspan="4"><b>Chromosome</b><br/> Expression for Function <code>n</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Gene</b><br/> Sub-expression <code>1</code> </td>
    <td><b>Gene</b><br/> Sub-expression <code>2</code> </td>
    <td><b>...</b></td>
    <td><b>Gene</b><br/> Sub-expression <code>m</code> </td>
    <td colspan="4"><b>Genes...</b></td>
    <td><b>...</b></td>
    <td colspan="4"><b>Genes...</b></td>
  </tr>
</table>

That is, the smallest components are the mathematical expressions that the `Gene`-types give rise to. These genes are combined in the `Chromosome`-types to form a complete mathematical expression representing a function. The `Individual`-type consists of all the chromosomes and represents a complete solution to a system of differential equations.

The above table depicts the structure of a solution to a system of `n` differential equations/functions, where each function is made up by `m` sub-expressions.

### Mutation

There are several mutation operators implemented, and they are divided in two parts.

**Gene mutation:** The main form of mutations acts on the `Gene`s and changes the mathematical expressions they give rise to. See `?mutate` for further explanation on this.

**Chromosome mutation:** A supplementary form of mutation that changes how the `Gene`s are combined to form a `Chromosome`, leaving the mathematical expressions of the `Gene`s fixed. See `?muthead` for more information.

### Crossover

There are some crossover operators implemented. These are interactions between `Individual`s such that they produce new solutions as offspring. See `?crossover` for more information.

### Fitness calculation

The fitness if calculated similar to that of **[TL]**. The fitness is here divided in three parts

* **error:** Sum of squares of the differential equations evaluated at a set number of uniformly distributed points over a given interval. (Also in **[TL]**)
* **penalty:** Absolute value of the mismatch for the boundary condition. (Also in **[TL]**)
* **shape:** This is the same as error, but evaluated for derivatives of the differential equation, with a decay-factor for each derivative. (Not in **[TL]**)

both penalty and shape can be turned off at your preference. The fitness is then simply given as the sum of these parts.

### Comments

The system-number `n` is actually only set by the number of functions involved in the system, meaning that the solver is blind to under- or over-determined systems.

That is, in an under-determined system of, say, five functions and one differential equation, the result will be *a* solution (if one exists, else an approximation) to this "system". In an over-determined system of, say, one function and five differential equations, the result will be the best approximation (or possibly exact solution iff the system is degenerate) found when the termination conditions were met.

The sub-expression number `m` is independent of any details of the problem, and can be chosen at will. It should however be noted that larger `m` will have negative effect on the time it takes to execute each iteration. See **[MF]** regarding the introduction of sub-expressions.

## Usage

Usage documentation is very lacking at the moment. But, it has been tried on a machine with the following

 * Julia v0.6.1
 * Julia packages Calculus and Iterators installed (`Pkg.add()`)
 * Rust v1.19.0
 * Cargo v0.21.0

The code is mostly Julia, however to circumvent some bugs in Julia there is a Rust library present that performs the fitness calculation. Before attempting to run any of the code, you should build that library

```$ cargo build```

from the root of this repository.

To start solving differential equations, there is yet not much user-friendly instructions nor documentation, but you can take a look at `src/solvers/TL_solver.jl` to begin with. Just try to run it.
