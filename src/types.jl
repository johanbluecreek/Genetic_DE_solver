"""
    Gene

Most basic type holding one mathematica expression.

Represents small/atomic mathematical expressions that should combine into expressions
representing solutions in a `Chromosome`.

"""
    Chromosome

A type holding several `Gene` types to form a more complex mathematical expression.

Represents a complete solution to a differential equation, possibly in a system. These are
mathematical expressions independent of the differential equation in these sense of that it
does not have a fitness. A collection of `Chromosome` types combine to an `Individual` that
represents the solution to the whole system (note that the system can be a system of one).
