# Even though ode1 only depends on 'x', [TL] uses 'x', 'y' and 'z' in their grammar
# so lets redefine the 'vars' present in 'ode1.jl'
#vars = ["x", "y", "z"]
# which also means we need to redefine ival and bc

# (that is, vcat(digits, vars) will not be different from vcat(digit, vars, vars))

# The grammar of [TL] is different,
# Chance to select any operator is equal to the chance of getting the unity operator,
# any function, or any digit. However, the variables x, y, z also have that same chance.
# Meaning vcat(digit, vars) will not be correct since this would give, e.g., '0' the same
# chance of being selected as 'x' -- which is not what [TL] has. The correct balance between
# digits and variables would be vcat(digit, repeat(vars, outer=10)) making the variable
# as likely as any digit.
# This means, normalising using vars, or the unity operator, the correct head is
head = vcat(repeat(operators, outer=5), repeat(["u"], outer=20), repeat(functions, outer=5), repeat(digits, outer=2), repeat(vars, outer=20));
# This is not completely correct, since the random number chosen by [TL] is 0:255, which
# will give an uneven distribution (due to modulus operations). I will not try and correct
# for this here.

# [TL] states that they use fixed length, although they do not specify how they fix the

# made out of head, having removed operators, unitary operator, and functions.
